## Introduction



* Given some samples $X_1, X_2, \dots, X_n \sim f(X|\theta)$, what is the standard error for the estimator $\hat{\theta}$ for $\theta$

* Say if we know $\theta$, we can simulate multiple samples 

sample 1: $X_1, X_2, \dots, X_n \sim f(X|\theta)$

Sample 2: $Y_1, Y_2, \dots, Y_n \sim f(X|\theta)$

Sample k: $Z_1, Z_2, \dots, Z_n \sim f(X|\theta)$

For each sample, we can get an estimate of $\theta$, can calculate the standard error. 

* The challenge is we do not know $\theta$ to begin with. 


# BootStraping

* Boot Strap is a method to obtain the sampling distribution of estimators using simulations. 

* In traditional simulation or a parametric framework, 
we assume that the data $X = \{x_1, ..., x_n\}$ comes from a given distribution $F$ or some model P.
* We usually estimate a given parameter $\theta$ from a sample X. Since X is random, $\theta$ is random itself. 
* We can sample X multiple times from F to give us different estimates 

# Bootstrap for Poisson Distribution 

Say we have some data coming Poisson distribtuion, the MLE is $\lambda$ is 5 and we need to estimate the standard error. 

Repeatedly simulate $X_1, \dots, X_n$ IID∼ Poisson(5),
compute $\lambda$ from each sample 
for each simulation, and compute the empirical
standard deviation of $\lambda$
across simulations.

```{r Poisson bootstrap}
# Input: Data vector X
lambda_hat = 5
n = 100
# Perform 100000 bootstrap simulations
B=100000
lambda_hat_star = numeric(B)
for (i in 1:B) {
X_star = rpois(n,lambda_hat)
lambda_hat_star[i] = mean(X_star)
}
print(sd(lambda_hat_star))

```

## Non Parametric bootstrap
* During non-parametric bootstrap, we do not make any distribution assumption regarding F but rather generate different data samples 
from the observed data itself. 

* We then estimate parameter $\theta$ based on the newly created samples.




```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("bootstrap_image.png")
```

```{r non parametric bootstrap}
# Perform 100000 bootstrap simulations
lambda_hat = 5
n = 100
X = rpois(n,lambda_hat)
###
B=100000
lambda_hat_star = numeric(B)
for (i in 1:B) {
X_star = sample(X, size=n, replace=TRUE)
lambda_hat_star[i] = mean(X_star)
}
print(sd(lambda_hat_star))

```

# Bootstrap Schematic

*The population is to the sample as the sample is to the bootstrap samples.*



* Each bootstrap data set contains n observations, sampled with replacement from the original data set.
* Each bootstrap data set is used to obtain an estimate of the parameter of interest.



## Regression confidence intervals using bootrap vs simulation

[In class discussion]


## Cross-validation vs the Bootstrap

**Cross-validation**: It is used to obtain an  estimate of the **test error**.

**Bootstrap**: provides the **standard error** of estimates.


## Application of Bootstrap 

# Portfolio Optimization Example

* Suppose that we wish to invest a fixed sum of money in two financial assets that yield returns of X and Y , respectively, where X and Y are random quantities. 
* We will invest a fraction $\alpha$ of our money in X, and will invest the remaining 1 − $\alpha$ in Y .
* Return ia $\alpha$ X + (1 − $\alpha$ )Y 
* Variance is Var($\alpha$ X + (1 − $\alpha$ )Y ) since there is variability associated with the returns on these two assets
* We wish to choose $\alpha$ to minimize the total risk, or variance, of our investment. 

* The $\alpha$ value that minimizes the risk is given by [HW question]

$$\alpha = \frac{\sigma_Y^2 - \sigma_{XY}^2}{\sigma_X^2 + \sigma_Y^2 - \sigma_{XY}^2}$$ 
* Here Var(X) = $\sigma_X^2$, Cov(X,Y) = $\sigma_{XY}^2$, Var(Y) = $\sigma_Y^2$ In reality these qunitites are not known. 
We can compute the estimates for these quantities for using a data set for past estimates. We create an estimate of $\alpha$
for each bootstrap sample based on sample variant estimate $\hat{\sigma_X}$, $\hat{\sigma_Y}$ and $\hat{\sigma_{XY}}$

## BootStrap Code

* The library boot is used to perform the  bootstrap
* The function input is the parameter estimation function from the sampled dataset

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}  
library(ISLR2)
library(boot)
attach(Portfolio)
```
```{r alphafunc}


alpha.fn <- function(data, index) {
X <- data$X[index]
Y <- data$Y[index]
(var(Y) - cov(X, Y)) / (var(X) + var(Y) - 2 * cov(X, Y))
}
boot(Portfolio, alpha.fn, R = 1000)
```
