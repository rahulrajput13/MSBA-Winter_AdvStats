## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

Showing plot of 'Probability that the Jth obs is in the Bootstrap' vs 'Sample Size'
```{r}

prob_inbootstrap = function(n) {
  1 - ((1-(1/n))^n)
}

#prob_inbootstrap(5)

prob = vector(length=100000)
samp_size = 1:100000
for (n in samp_size) {
  prob[n] = prob_inbootstrap(n)
}

plot(samp_size,prob,type = 'l',ylim=c(0,1))

sprintf("The result is quite interesting, it shows that as the sample size increases the probability of the Jth obs being in the Bootstrap sample becomes almost constant after a certain threshold. Intuitively, this contradicts the result expected from formula.")
```
